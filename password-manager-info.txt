Code-Server Access Information for Password Manager
==================================================

URL: http://127.0.0.1:8091
Username: code-server (or leave blank)
Password: a1544904J$

Note: Code-Server doesn't use usernames, but you can save it in your password manager as:
- Username: "code-server" or "admin" or leave blank
- Password: a1544904J$
- URL: http://127.0.0.1:8091

Alternative: Some password managers allow saving credentials without a username field.

For auto-fill to work properly:
1. The login form only has a password field
2. You may need to configure your password manager to fill password-only forms
3. Or use the password manager's manual fill option
