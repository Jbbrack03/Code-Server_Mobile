# Mobile Terminal Access for Code-Server
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Executive Summary

This project creates a mobile-optimized solution for accessing and managing terminal sessions from a self-hosted code-server instance. The solution consists of a VS Code extension that exposes terminal session management APIs and a native iOS app that provides an optimized mobile interface for terminal interaction and Claude Code integration.

### Problem Statement

Current limitations with code-server mobile access:
- Terminal sessions don't persist when accessing from mobile browsers
- VS Code's web interface is not optimized for mobile interaction
- No efficient way to switch between multiple active terminal sessions on mobile
- Claude Code interactions require typing commands manually on mobile keyboards
- Poor mobile UX for development workflows that span multiple projects

### Goals

**Primary Goals:**
- Enable seamless access to existing terminal sessions from mobile devices
- Provide mobile-optimized interface for terminal interaction
- Create efficient terminal session switching mechanism
- Integrate Claude Code quick commands for mobile use
- Support fully customizable command creation by users

**Secondary Goals:**
- Maintain security and authentication for remote access
- Support real-time terminal output streaming
- Enable offline command queuing for poor network conditions
- Support customizable Claude Code command shortcuts
- Allow users to create and edit their own command shortcuts

### Success Metrics

- Time to switch between terminal sessions < 2 seconds
- Mobile terminal interaction success rate > 95%
- Claude Code command execution time < 3 seconds
- User can complete development tasks on mobile without switching to desktop

### User Stories

**As a developer, I want to:**
- View all my active terminal sessions from my iPhone
- Switch quickly between different project terminals
- Send Claude Code commands with one tap instead of typing
- Create and customize my own Claude Code command shortcuts
